Ardulab was a software and hardware system that enabled fully autonomous
execution of science experiments aboard the International Space Station. The
Ardulab hardware consisted mainly of a machined aluminum chassis and integrated
circuit board. The software OS was arduino with an included data and I/O layer
to extend the baseline arduino capability and to integrate and communicate with
the ISS computer interface. Ardulab was designed and manufactured by Manu
